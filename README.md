An iOS app for looking up movies through RottenTomatoes.

Time Spent:
* Approx. 10 hours

Work Done:
* All the required parts.
* Fading in of the higher resolution pic.
* Search Bar
* Network Error that comes up if the request fails (20s timeout), and disappears on reload. Also fades in when appearing and disappearing.
* Modifying the Navbar: Navbar is translucent, so when you scroll the movies, you can see them passing through the navbar.
* Displaying the Rotten Tomato audience and critics score, and highlighting them when the score > 80 for any of the categories (along with runtime, rating, cast etc. on main screen).
* LaunchScreen tweaks and AppIcon.
* Minor UI tweaks (background image in the detail view, rounded corners for the rating label, etc.)

Problems:
* AppIcon isn't displayed for some reason.
* Higher res images don't scale to fit in the screen properly.
